#ifdef TORCH_ASSERT_NO_OPERATORS
#error This change adds a dependency on native_functions.yaml,            \
  meaning the file will need to be re-compiled every time an operator     \
  is changed or added. Consider if your change would be better placed in  \
  another file, or if a more specific header might achieve the same goal. \
  See NOTE: [Tensor vs. TensorBase]
